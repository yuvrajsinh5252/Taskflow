# Scheduling Algorithm

This project implements a scheduling algorithm that optimizes the allocation of resources based on certain criteria. The algorithm aims to efficiently assign tasks to available resources, taking into consideration factors such as task priority, resource availability, and task dependencies.

## Algorithm Overview

1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2. SJF (Shortest Job First)
3. RR (Round Robin)
4. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
